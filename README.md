# React Practice Project

This project contains various components and exercises built while learning React. It serves as a hands-on learning environment for concepts like state, effects, props, and working with APIs.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `MiniProject.js` - Fetches and displays quotes, along with a real-time clock.
- `App.js` - Main entry point rendering all components.
- `MiniProject.css` - Styles for the mini project.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Fetching quotes from an API
- Using `useEffect` to manage side effects like fetching data or updating time
- Managing state with `useState`
- Real-time clock using `setInterval`
- Error handling and loading states
- Button click triggers new quote fetch

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (via `create-react-app`)
- JavaScript ES6+
- HTML/CSS

## 📂 Git Workflow

- Work is done on the `mark-dev` branch
- Changes are merged into `development` after testing
- Final tested features go into `main`

## 💻 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd my-react-app


<!-- npm install --> install dependencies
<!-- npm start -->  run project
